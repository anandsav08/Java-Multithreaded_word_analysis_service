# Java-Multithreaded_word_analysis_service
@Author : Anand Kumar

This is a multi-threaded word analysis service project.

It has two parts:
1. Words generator service : It generates words parallely by multiple worker threads
2. Words analysis service : It analyses the words generated by part 1 via multiple threads to give stats such as:
longest word, smallest word, longest word length, smallest word length and a final words count map(frequency of each word in the words list)
